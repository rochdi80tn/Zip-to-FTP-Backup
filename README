Zip to Backup - Johann du Toit v0.1.0
=======================

Takes a List of configured directories. Zips them then uploads to a FTP Server. Deleting any Records older than a configured stale variable.

Requirements
========================
Nothing Just Python :D

Why?
========================
Was helping with providing backups to the Infrastructure and could not find a quick and small too to do this. So I wrote one. Nothing big, we run it every once a week through Windows Task Scheduler

backupcfg.ini
========================

You can configure a bunch of options for the Script:
[default]:		the backup prefeix

[folders]: 		Any Folders listed under [folders] will be zipped. These can be
			networked files, local files, mounted drives anything just as long
			as you have access to it.
			For Example
			[folders]
			folder1=\\computer\myimportantfiles
			folder2=c:\Users|dir
		
[ftp]:			Configure FTP Details in this Section
username:		Your FTP Server's Username to login with
password: 		Your FTP Server's Password for the Previous indicated Username
host:			Host address of your Server either.
keep_for_months:	After how many months is a zip seen as stale.

Example Config File
------------------------
[default]
backup_prefix= backup_

[folders]
folder1=\\computer\myimportantfiles
folder2=c:\Users|dir

[ftp]
username=ftp_username
password=ftp_password
host=ftp_host
keep_for_months = 2
------------------------

Usage
========================
To run the Script just configure the .ini file, go to the directory of the script and use:
python backup_to_ftp.py
